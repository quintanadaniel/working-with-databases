# Working with databases

This is a perosnal project where I'm using different database and connecting with python.

This is a general project as Data Engineer, and here we imported different files input and get output files.

I have a docker compose, let me to simulate instances like mongo, redis, postgres, mysql, sqlite, etc.

Additional information will be provided about the fundamental tasks and ideas of a Data Engineer.
